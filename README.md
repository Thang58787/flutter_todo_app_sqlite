## Description
Simple Note - A simple Flutter Note-Taking App
I'm a Flutter beginner. While learning programming, I want to apply what I learned to a real project.  And this repo is my result. From [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpKrhZ0Hppk&t=229s), I have added some functions to the app to make its more usable.
